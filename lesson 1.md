## Tone
![4 tones in mandarin](https://chinesefor.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chinesefor.us-pronunciation-tone-drills-l1p1-mandarin-chinese-tones-lesson-practice-1024x576.png)
Let's start with 啊, a character simply meaning people making the "a" sound. It has 3 different tones in different context. No character pronounces as "ǎ", it's just here for a tone pratice.

You might ask, if you see the character 啊, how to pronounce it? The answer is it depends on the context. If you see 啊 in text messages with limited context, it could be ambiguous. How to intepret character with multiple pronunciations (多音字) could trigger endless debates among the professionals.

All individual characters are pronounced at equal length, there is no shorter vowel vs longer vowel, etc. 

| Tone | Similar tone in English | Example |              Scenario               |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ā    | **A**men.               | 啊——     | Dentist asks you to open your mouth |
| á    | Wh**a**t? H**u**h?      | 啊？     | Confused, questioning               |
| ǎ    |                         |         |                                     |
| à    | **A**h. **O**h.         | 啊！     | Exclamation                         |
| a    |                         | 是啊。   | Only at the end of sentence         |


#### The 1st Tone: ā 
It is a flat tone, but there is a sort of "absolute" pitch, which is different from the way English focuses on the relative rise and fall in tone.
Try to sing: do, re, mi. ā would be about the pitch of mi.


#### The 2nd Tone: á
It is a rising tone, similar as questioning.


#### The 3rd Tone: ǎ
It hardly has an English equivalent, which is tricky. Try to make the "ah" sound at your lowest pitch possible. Then lift your throat back to the neutral position (as if you are preparing to speak the next character).

If you are a monkey, the quick hack is to find equivalent tone in other languages you are familiar with...

If there are two consecutive characters in the 3rd tone, read the first character in 2nd tone.

* 你好 nǐ hǎo ==> read as ní hǎo
* 我很好 wǒ hěn hǎo ==> read as wǒ hén hǎo


#### The 4th Tone: à
It starts at high pitch and falls to lower, similar as exclamation. 


#### The 5th Tone: a
Usually people say Chinese has 4 tones. The 5th tone is simply to pronounce at a light, flat tone without emphasis, lower pitch than the 1st tone.

Similar with the special pronunciation with consecutive 3rd tone, the 5th tone is never an official pronunciation on the dictionary, only applies within the context of a word or sentence.
* Two same characters. 大猩猩 dà xīng xīng ==> dà xīng xing
* End-of-sentence particle. 是啊 shì ā ==> shì a
* Generic character at the end of a word. 猴子 hóu zǐ ==> hóu zi
